# AutoTuneML: Automated Hyperparameter Tuning for Machine Learning Models

AutoTuneML is a Python library designed to automate the process of hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. It utilizes techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and genetic algorithms to efficiently search through the hyperparameter space and find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given model.

## Features

- Automated hyperparameter tuning for various machine learning models
- Supports grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and genetic algorithms
- Customizable hyperparameter grids and optimization techniques
- Provides the best hyperparameters found and model accuracy on the test set

## Installation

To install AutoTuneML, you can use pip:

pip install autotuneml


## Usage

To use AutoTuneML, you can import the `tune_hyperparameters` function from the `autotuneml` module and provide your dataset X and y as arguments. Here's an example usage:

```python
from autotuneml import tune_hyperparameters

# Load your dataset here
X = ...
y = ...

# Call the hyperparameter tuning function
tune_hyperparameters(X, y)
