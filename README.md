## Overview:
HyperTuneML is a Python library designed to automate hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. This tool streamlines the process of finding optimal hyperparameters, enhancing model performance and efficiency.

## Installation:
### Download the Code:
Download the `hyperparameter_tuning.py` file from this repository.
### Import HyperTuneML:
In your Python script, import HyperTuneML using:
```python
from hyperparameter_tuning import HyperTuneML

## Usage:
### Loading Your Dataset:
Prepare your dataset for model training.
### Setting Up Hyperparameters:
Define the hyperparameters you want to tune in your model.
### Using HyperTuneML for Tuning:
Create an instance of HyperTuneML and specify the model, hyperparameters, and optimization technique to use.
### Running the Tuning Process:
Initiate the tuning process with HyperTuneML to optimize hyperparameters.
### Evaluating Results:
Analyze the performance of different hyperparameter configurations suggested by HyperTuneML.
### Fine-Tuning and Refinement:
Iterate on the results obtained to further refine and improve model performance.
### Saving Your Optimized Model:
Save your optimized model for future use or deployment.

## Example Code Snippet:
```python
from hyperparameter_tuning import HyperTuneML

# Load dataset
# Define hyperparameters
# Initialize HyperTuneML
tuner = HyperTuneML(model=model, hyperparameters=hyperparams, optimization='grid_search')

# Run tuning process
tuner.tune()

# Evaluate results and fine-tune model
# Save optimized model
